# Aragon OSx Developer Portal

Aragon's Developer Portal holds all documentation developers need to kickstart their journey building with the Aragon OSx stack. You can find it in production [here](https://devs.aragon.org). 

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a static website generator for technical documentations.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
