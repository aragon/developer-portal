title: Is Member

### Check if an address is a member of an Addresslist DAO in a specific block and plugin

The is member function receives the plugin address and the address to check as parameters and returns a boolean value.

```ts
import { AddresslistVotingClient } from "@aragon/sdk-client";
import { context } from "../index";

// Instantiate the addresslist voting client from the Aragon OSx SDK context.
const client: AddresslistVotingClient = new AddresslistVotingClient(context);

const isMember = await client.methods.isMember({
  pluginAddress: "0x2345678901234567890123456789012345678901",
  address: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
  blockNumber: 12345678,
});

console.log(isMember);
```


Returns:
    ```tsx
    true
    ```
