## Remove Members from the Addresslist Voting Plugin

Removes an address from the Addresslist plugin so that this address is no longer able to vote in AddresslistVoting proposals.

### Encoding

```ts
import { DaoAction } from "@aragon/sdk-client-common";
import { addresslistVotingClient } from "./index";

// Addresses to remove from the AddressList plugin.
const members: string[] = [
  "0x1357924680135792468013579246801357924680",
  "0x2468013579246801357924680135792468013579",
  "0x0987654321098765432109876543210987654321",
];

const pluginAddress: string = "0x0987654321098765432109876543210987654321"; // the address of the AddresslistVoting plugin contract installed in the DAO

const action: DaoAction = addresslistVotingClient.encoding.removeMembersAction(
  pluginAddress,
  members,
);
console.log({ action });
```


Returns:

```json
{ action:
  {
    to: "0x1234567890...",
    value: 0n,
    data: Uint8Array[12,34,45...]
  }
}
```

### Decoding

```ts
const decodedParams: string[] = addresslistVotingClient.decoding
  .removeMembersAction(action.data);
console.log({ decodedParams });
```


Returns:

```
{ decodedParams:
  [
    "0x12345...",
    "0x56789...",
    "0x13579..."
  ]
}
