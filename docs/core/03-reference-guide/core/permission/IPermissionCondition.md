###  contract `IPermissionCondition`

This interface can be implemented to support more customary permissions depending on on- or off-chain state, e.g., by querying token ownershop or a secondary condition, respectively.

#### external function `isGranted`

This method is used to check if a call is permitted.

```solidity
function isGranted(address _where, address _who, bytes32 _permissionId, bytes _data) external view returns (bool allowed) 
```
