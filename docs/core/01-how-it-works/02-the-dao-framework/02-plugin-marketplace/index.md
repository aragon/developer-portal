## Customize Your DAO

The Aragon Plugin Marketplace is the place for Aragon and third-party plugins that you can add to customize and adapt your DAO to your needs.
To be accepted, plugins have to pass an audit process to ensure their security.

The marketplace and audit processes will be managed through a marketplace DAO.
This DAO is run initially by Aragon and then progressively decentralized to be owned and ran by the community. This prevents Aragon from becoming a gatekeeper.
