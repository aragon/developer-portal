# Plugins: Customizing your DAO

To add features beyond the base functionality available, you can customize your aragonOS DAO by installing a wide variety of plugins.

Plugins can be related to:

- **Governance:** provides the DAO with different **collective decision-making** mechanisms such as token or address-based majority voting, conviction voting, etc. Depending on the governance architecture decided, we can set different governance mechanisms based on whichever parameter we may need.

:::note
Typically, governance plugins have the permission to execute actions on the DAO.
:::

- **Finance:** allows the DAO to manage its **treasury** or use it to invest (e.g., in lending, staking, or NFT mints)

:::note
Typically, finance plugins have the permission to withdraw tokens from the DAO.
:::

- **Membership:** determines **who** will be a part of the DAO and their roles within them. This can mean minting governance tokens like [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), NFTs, or any other token standard.

:::note
Typically, membership related plugins grant permissions (e.g., based on token ownership) to EOAs or contracts.
:::

- And **anything** else that comes to mind!

These plugins are curated and on the Aragon Marketplace. In the next section, we will learn more about plugins and the Aragon Marketplace.
