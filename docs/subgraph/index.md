## The On-Chain Information

In Aragon we use [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/), a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. The Graph makes it possible to query data that is difficult to retrieve directly from the Smart Contracts.

The Aragon Subgraph stores all DAO-related information, either to help users to manage and interact with their DAOs or to query useful information, such as its treasury information, members, plugins, etc.

On this site, can be found help with [queries](./01-queryExample/index.md) as well as all the documentation for our [subgraph schema](./reference-guide/index.md)

## Playground

We encourage users to test the [Aragon subgraph-satsuma playground](https://subgraph.satsuma-prod.com/aragon/osx-mainnet/playground) to fully understand what information is available and how to access it.

Query examples to illustrate how information can be queried are provided in the [Query Examples site](./01-queryExample/index.md).

- [DAO queries](./01-queryExample/01-dao-query.md)
- [Balances queries](./01-queryExample/02-balances-query.md)
