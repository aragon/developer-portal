## The On-Chain Information

Subgraph is a protocol for indexing and querying event data emitted from the smart contracts.

The Aragon Subgraph stores all DAO-related information, either to help users to manage and interact with their DAOs or to query useful information, such as its treasury information, members, plugins, etc.

On this site, can be found help with [queries](./01-queryExample/index.md) as well as all the documentation for our [subgraph schema](./reference-guide/index.md)

## Playground

You can use the [Aragon subgraph-satsuma playground](https://subgraph.satsuma-prod.com/aragon/osx-mainnet/playground) for testing.

Examples queries are provided in the [Query Example](./01-queryExample/index.md) section.

- [DAO queries](./01-queryExample/01-dao-query.md)
- [Balances queries](./01-queryExample/02-balances-query.md)
