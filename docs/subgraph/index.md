## The Graph [WIP]

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. The Graph makes it possible to query data that is difficult to query directly.

## Aragon Subgraph

In Aragon we use subgraph to retrieve information od our DAOs.

In this site you will find help with queries as well as all the documentation for our [subgraph schema](https://github.com/aragon/osx/blob/develop/packages/subgraph/schema.graphql)

## Playground

We encourage you to test the Aragon [subgraph-satsuma playground](https://subgraph.satsuma-prod.com/aragon/osx-mainnet/playground)

We will guide you with some query examples

- [DAO queries](./01-queryExample/01-dao-query.md)
- [Balances queries](./01-queryExample/02-balances-query.md)
