== Aragon OSx

OSx is our Ethereum-based smart contract framework. It enables organizations to deploy custom governance tailored to their unique needs and securely adapt over time. It was designed to overcome the monolithic one-size-fits-approach commonly used by onchain organizations.

**The central principle behind OSx is that permissions are the core primitive that enables effective governance in any complex organization**.

== Aragon Plugin Marketplace

Permissions can be granted to an OSx plugin address. Plugins contain governance logic inside of reusable contracts. Each plugin is limited in scope, with single-purpose logic that can be mixed and matched to compose novel governance designs.

**Explore or publish your own community-built plugins** that can be used to extend any OSx-based organization with new governance logic.


== Governance Tooling

The Governance UI Kit and Governance App Template are used to build custom applications and UIs that integrate seamlessly with OSx.
